            <p>With the Release of Ozark Empire, Listener began their first Tour of Homes. This consisted almost entirely of traveling from home to home around the United States (the European leg of the tour was titled the European Tour of Homes) in a grassroots style of touring. Not only playing in standard live music venues they also played in houses, coffee shops, art galleries and warehouses.</p>

            <p>Listener recently played the Livemusic Social Club. Here they mentioned what the foundation is to their music: "It would be not through any filter that society or this world offers, that's honest and from the heart. Not having any agenda or some kind of ulterior motive or intention, whether it's to be cool, indie or avant-garde, none of that - and to just do it."</p>

            <p>Listener released their eighth studio album, Wooden Heart independently on July 6, 2010. Six of the tracks featured on the album were used on their previous release, "Not Waving, Drowning".[2] The album was released as 1000 Vinyl pressings; 100 in Black, 200 in White, 300 in Clear and Black and 400 in Teal.</p>
