            <p>Man Man released their debut The Man in a Blue Turban with a Face in October 2004 on Ace Fu Records, but they did not begin to tour extensively until their follow-up album Six Demon Bag was released in 2006 to positive reviews. During 2007, the band opened for Modest Mouse on several U.S tours, gaining them further public attention. Not long afterward, Nike began airing a series of commercials starring Rainn Wilson with Man Man's "10 lb Mustache" as the background music.[1] "10 lb Mustache", "Feathers", and "Engwish Bwudd" were featured in season 3, episode 8 of the TV show Weeds. The band also recorded a cover of "Little Boxes" for the title sequence of that episode.<p/>

            <p>Man Man released their third studio album Rabbit Habits on ANTI- in 2008, and embarked on a North American tour in March 2008, with Yeasayer and Tim Fite splitting dates. They performed at numerous festivals including Voodoo Experience, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, All Tomorrow's Parties, Primavera Sound, and the Meredith Music Festival that same year.</p>

            <p>Man Man released their fourth album Life Fantastic in May 2011 with producer Mike Mogis (of Bright Eyes and Monsters of Folk fame). Choosing to abandon their previous "wacky" sound, in favor of a more somber sound. The first song written for the album was "Steak Knives," inspired by a failed relationship and the death of a close friend. It took Kattner (Honus Honus) over a year to write.</p>

            <p>Honus has made an album with Nicholas Thorburn of Islands and The Unicorns, and Joe Plummer of Modest Mouse and The Shins under the name, Mister Heavenly. Thorburn has suggested he and Honus are making a record in a new subgenre called "Doom Wop," consisting of slow, low-frequency music transposed with traditional doo wop harmonies.</p>
