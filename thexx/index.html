            <p>The xx are an English indie pop band, formed in London in 2008. The group released their debut album, xx in August 2009. The album ranked highly on many best of 2009 lists, placing number one on the list compiled by The Guardian and second for NME. In 2010, the band won the Mercury Music Prize for their debut album. Their second album, Coexist, was released on 10 September 2012.</p>

            <p>The band met whilst studying at Elliott School, the same school that produced Hot Chip, Burial and Four Tet. The group, however, have downplayed the influence of the school on their career: "A teacher from Elliott who had never even taught us said how great we were. It's a bit annoying. We were left alone, more than anything - although I'm sure that helped us in its own way." Oliver Sim and Romy Madley-Croft started the band as a duo when they were 15. Guitarist Baria Qureshi joined once they began performing in 2005, with Jamie Smith joining a year after.</p>
