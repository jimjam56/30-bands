            <p>The Microphones were a lo-fi band based in Olympia, Washington, and fronted by Phil Elvrum. Elvrum is the principal member of the band, but he has collaborated with many other musicians on his records.</p>

            <p>In 2004, Elvrum announced that he had changed the name of his band to Mount Eerie, and has since put out many releases as Mount Eerie, including six full-length albums. In January 2007, Elvrum released a new single under the Microphones moniker, titled Two Songs by the Microphones, the only Microphones release since the name change. He has since continued to release music as Mount Eerie.</p>
